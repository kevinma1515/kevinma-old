I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Dr. Kosa Goucher-Lambert](http://www.kosagl.com/) in the [Co-Design Lab](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/) affiliated with the [Berkeley Institute of Design](http://bid.berkeley.edu/). I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin. 

My research interest lies in the intersection of *engineering design*, *artificial intelligence*, and *cognitive science*. My current research lies in the development of new design tools and methodologies that will (1) make the designer's life easier, (2) enhance the designer's capabilities, and (3) stimulate the designer's creativity. Previously, I did my undergraduate research project on modelling individual risk for [COVID-19](https://github.com/kevin-m-1515/COVID-Individual-Risk-Calculator), which was graciously advised by [Dr. Michael Lachmann](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/michael-lachmann) and [Dr. Jennifer Johnson-Leung](https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/mathstat/our-people/faculty/jenfns).

Outside of research and work, you can find me practicing ballroom dancing, training olympic-style weightlifting, or walking around large trees and mountains.
